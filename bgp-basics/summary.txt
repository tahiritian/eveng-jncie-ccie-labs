- Multipath: Multipath Load Sharing Between eBGP and iBGP.  Install multiple to the forwarding table.
- Graceful restart: Allows a routing device undergoing a restart to inform its adjacent neighbors and peers of its condition. Graceful restart is disabled by default. However, helper mode, the ability to assist a neighboring router attempting a graceful restart, is enabled by default.

----- iBGP default behavior ------
# WITHOUT LOOPBACK: Adjacency based on physical interface IP. Loopback reachable via OSPF (set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface lo0.0)
# WITH LOOPBACK: Adjacency based on loopback IP. Router-ID used (set routing-options router-id x.x.x.x )

— On R8: Create another loopback IP and advertise to neighbor R6/R7:
  --- ** Using protocol ‘direct’ instead ‘BGP’ to avoid iBGP default behavior.
  --- ** By default, only active BGP routes are advertised.

The rules are as simple as follows:
1. IBGP peers advertise routes received from EBGP peers to other IBGP peers.
2. EBGP peers advertise routes learned from IBGP or EBGP peers to other EBGP peers.
To be Noticed: IBGP peers do not advertise routes received from IBGP peers to other IBGP peers[unless it is functioning as a route reflector]. The purpose of the advertisement rules is to prevent routing loops on a BGP network.

	--- default iBGP behavior is override by using Route Reflector.

-------------------------------------
	
----- eBGP default behavior ------	EBGP peers advertise routes learned from IBGP or EBGP peers to other EBGP peers.
eBGP peering use the same kind of  configuration as iBGP for Authentication and Loopback. 
Basic eBGP peering config with loopback advertisement into eBGP.
